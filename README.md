<!-- Tas DESCRIPTION -->

We are looking to pull in data from our client’s site to create a database of the client’s product information.<br/>
Our client’s site is myer.com.au<br/>
Please review the site, and identify the best approach to pull the following information from the site:<br/>
● Category list<br/>
● Product Detail<br/>


Please note:
● We do not have access to the client’s internal IT team or any other documentation<br/>
● Our solution will need to be found by investigating the client’s website<br/>
● We have the option to give a JavaScript code to the client to always load in their website.<br/>
Similar to how we add Google Analytics/Google Tag Manager JavaScript embed code in
any website.<br/><br/>
JS <br/>
Data Push Product page URL - https://www.myer.com.au/p/converse-chuck-taylor-all-star-hi-sneaker<br/>
Write the javascript code, which can be embedded in the product page, and on page load it will
find the product information listed below and call a given end point to push the product data -<br/>
● Product name<br/>
● Product’s variant reference id (for example, same product is available in multiple colour,
and each colour has a unique SKU/reference id)<br/>
● Product price<br/>
○ For product price information, please check the site to check if there is a potential
variation when there is a discount given to a product by the retailer<br/><br/>
CSS<br/>
Go to - https://www.myer.com.au/p/skechers-go-walk-glide-step-flex-ryder-sneaker-in-black<br/>
In this page, you will find a section called “Others also viewed” -Replicate this section, and add an “Add to cart” button underneath each element. Your HTML &
CSS, we should be able to add to the site using “Element Inspect”, and it should display
properly.<br/>
** The sliding functionality is not required<br/>
** Extra/bonus points will be considered if the “Add to cart” button works, and it actually adds the
element to the shopping cart<br/>

** Usage **
Copy the script tag from html file and paste into web page at the bottom of the body.
